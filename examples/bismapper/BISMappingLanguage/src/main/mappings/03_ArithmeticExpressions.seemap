        Exercise:

        An input message contains 207 items.
        In the output, the items have to be written in groups of max. 5 items.
        Compute how many groups are needed.
        Write the result to a leaf node named "numberOfGroups".

        Expected output:Â´

        <numberOfGroups>42</numberOfGroups>
